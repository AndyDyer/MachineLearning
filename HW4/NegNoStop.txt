it's

there
although
it's

it

really
add
much
it's
better

channel
but
there's
no
arguing
the
tone
the

-
it
leaves
bad
taste
your

an

so
love
with
its
overinflated

it
no

prolonged
extrusion
psychopathic
pulp
borrows

so
dull
its

one-dimensional
the

superficial
will
probably
be

its

sorvino

cartoonish
the
film
only
really
comes
alive
when
poor

pathetically
compare

their

it's

otherwise
everything

watch

celebrity
cameos

neither
do
cliches

the

dickensian
sensibility

close
to
justifying
the
hype
that
surrounded
its
debut
at
the

two
years

the
plot
is
paper-thin
and
the
characters

interesting

to
watch
them
go
about
their
daily
activities
for
two
whole

kaufman's
script
is
never
especially
clever
and
often
is
rather
pretentious
.
the
film

move
me

way
or
the

it
was
an
honest
effort

if
you

to
see
a
flick

this
one

there

in
this
film
we
at
least
see
a

strangely

no

you
have
once
again
entered
the
bizarre
realm
where
director
adrian
lyne
holds
sway
,
where
all
relationships
are
simultaneously
broadly
metaphorical
,
oddly
abstract
,
and
excruciatingly
literal
.
the
high-concept
scenario
soon
proves
preposterous
,
the
acting
is
robotically
italicized
,
and
truth-in-advertising
hounds
take
note
:
there's
very
little
hustling
on
view
.
this
director's
cut
--
which
adds
51
minutes
--
takes
a
great
film
and
turns
it
into
a
mundane
soap
opera
.
characterisation
has
been
sacrificed
for
the
sake
of
spectacle
.
the
venezuelans
say
things
like
"
si
,
pretty
much
"
and
"
por
favor
,
go
home
"
when
talking
to
americans
.
that's
muy
loco
,
but
no
more
ridiculous
than
most
of
the
rest
of
"
dragonfly
.
"
it's
a
movie
that
ends
with
truckzilla
,
for
cryin'
out
loud
.
if
that
doesn't
clue
you
in
that
something's
horribly
wrong
,
nothing
will
.
director
tom
shadyac
and
star
kevin
costner
glumly
mishandle
the
story's
promising
premise
of
a
physician
who
needs
to
heal
himself
.
it's
difficult
to
imagine
that
a
more
confused
,
less
interesting
and
more
sloppily
made
film
could
possibly
come
down
the
road
in
2002
.
like
the
tuck
family
themselves
,
this
movie
just
goes
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
as
pedestrian
as
they
come
.
a
film
that
plays
things
so
nice
'n
safe
as
to
often
play
like
a
milquetoast
movie
of
the
week
blown
up
for
the
big
screen
.
it's
a
feel-bad
ending
for
a
depressing
story
that
throws
a
bunch
of
hot-button
items
in
the
viewer's
face
and
asks
to
be
seen
as
hip
,
winking
social
commentary
.

between

more
intellectually
scary
than
dramatically

.
an
inconsequential
,
barely
there
bit
of
piffle
.
the
abiding
impression
,
despite
the
mild
hallucinogenic
buzz
,
is
of
overwhelming
waste
--
the
acres
of
haute
couture
can't
quite
conceal
that
there's
nothing
resembling
a
spine
here
.
as
saccharine
as
it
is
disposable
.
you
come
away
thinking
not
only
that
kate
isn't
very
bright
,
but
that
she
hasn't
been
worth
caring
about
and
that
maybe
she
,
janine
and
molly
--
an
all-woman
dysfunctional
family
--
deserve
one
another
.
the
metaphors
are
provocative
,
but
too
often
,
the
viewer
is
left
puzzled
by
the
mechanics
of
the
delivery
.
very
much
a
home
video
,
and
so
devoid
of
artifice
and
purpose
that
it
appears
not
to
have
been
edited
at
all
.
too
much
power
,
not
enough
puff
.
the
attempt
to
build
up
a
pressure
cooker
of
horrified
awe
emerges
from
the
simple
fact
that
the
movie
has
virtually
nothing
to
show
.
it's
provocative
stuff
,
but
the
speculative
effort
is
hampered
by
taylor's
cartoonish
performance
and
the
film's
ill-considered
notion
that
hitler's
destiny
was
shaped
by
the
most
random
of
chances
.
a
cellophane-pop
remake
of
the
punk
classic

crossroads
is
never
much
worse
than
bland
or
better
than
inconsequential
.
muddled
,
trashy
and
incompetent
for
this
sort
of
thing
to
work
,
we
need
agile
performers
,
but
the
proficient
,
dull
sorvino
has
no
light
touch
,
and
rodan
is
out
of
his
league
.
narc
is
all
menace
and
atmosphere
.
though
excessively
tiresome
,
the
uncertainty
principle
,
as
verbally
pretentious
as
the
title
may
be
,
has
its
handful
of
redeeming
features
,
as
long
as
you
discount
its
ability
to
bore
.
despite
juliet
stevenon's
attempt
to
bring
cohesion
to
pamela's
emotional
roller
coaster
life
,
it
is
not
enough
to
give
the
film
the
substance
it
so
desperately
needs
.
it's
tough
to
be
startled
when
you're
almost
dozing
.
his
[nelson's]
screenplay
needs
some
serious
re-working
to
show
more
of
the
dilemma
,
rather
than
have
his
characters
stage
shouting
matches
about
it
.
it's
so
downbeat
and
nearly
humorless
that
it
becomes
a
chore
to
sit
through
--
despite
some
first-rate
performances
by
its
lead
.
a
terrible
movie
that
some
people
will
nevertheless
find
moving
.
there
are
many
definitions
of
'time
waster'
but
this
movie
must
surely
be
one
of
them
.
as
it
stands
,
crocodile
hunter
has
the
hurried
,
badly
cobbled
look
of
the
1959
godzilla
,
which
combined
scenes
of
a
japanese
monster
flick
with
canned
shots
of
raymond
burr
commenting
on
the
monster's
path
of
destruction
.
the
thing
looks
like
a
made-for-home-video
quickie
.
enigma
is
well-made
,
but
it's
just
too
dry
and
too
placid
.
