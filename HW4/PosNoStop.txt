'it's

i
had
a
dream
that
a
smart
comedy
would
come
along
to
rescue
me
from
a
summer
of
teen-driven
,
toilet-humor
codswallop
,
and
its
name
was
earnest
.
even
though
the
film
doesn't
manage
to
hit
all
of
its
marks
,
it's
still
entertaining
to
watch
the
target
practice
.
where
this
was
lazy
but
enjoyable
,
a
formula
comedy
redeemed
by
its
stars
,
that
is
even
lazier
and
far
less
enjoyable

globe
,
are
stanzas
of
breathtaking
,
awe-inspiring
visual
poetry
.

attraction
between
these
two
marginal
characters
is
complex
from
the
start

and
,
refreshingly
,
stays
that
way

what
sets
this
romantic
comedy
apart
from

hollywood

is
its
low-key
way
of

seems

enough

energy

the
fanatical

know
